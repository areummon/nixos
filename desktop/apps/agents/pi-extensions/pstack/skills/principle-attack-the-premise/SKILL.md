# Pi runtime contract

This contract adapts the bundled Cursor pstack instructions to Pi. Where the
upstream text describes Cursor-only behavior, use this contract instead.
It never overrides system instructions, AGENTS.md, permissions, or sandbox rules.

- `Task` means OptChat `spawn({tasks: [...]})`. Only delegate when the user has
  requested subagents or explicitly invoked a delegation workflow such as
  `/swarm`, `/architect`, `/interrogate`, `/how`, `/why`, `/arena`, or `/reflect`.
  Enabling `/poteto-mode` alone does not authorize subagents for every task.
- OptChat returns IDs immediately. Never sleep, poll, or wait for children.
  Continue independent work or end the turn and explain what is running.
  Reports arrive automatically. Aggregate only after the relevant batch reports.
  `tell({id,message})` steers running children; finished children cannot resume.
- Children inherit the configured OptChat model/effort, run locally in the same
  workspace, and cannot spawn recursively. Ignore Cursor model slugs, role-model
  rules, cloud environments, `Task` model parameters, and `subagent_type` fields.
  Different reviewer briefs are different perspectives, NOT different models.
  If a workflow needs nested delegation, have the parent coordinate its stages.
- For a poteto delegate, include paths to `agents/poteto-agent.md`, this contract,
  the relevant SKILL.md and playbook in the brief. For comment review include
  `agents/comment-sicko.md`. Paths are relative to this package root. Ask the
  child to read them. Every brief includes scope, verification, and report format.
- Children share the working tree. Use read-only reviews or disjoint write
  scopes. Do not assume separate branches or cloud worktrees exist. Never let
  workers edit the same files concurrently without explicit isolation.
- `AskQuestion` means `ask_user_question` if available. Otherwise ask in chat.
  Never skip an approval because the prompt asks for autonomy. A plan/todolist
  is a concise Markdown checklist, not a nonexistent Cursor tool.
- Invocation of another skill means read its SKILL.md and apply it; do not try
  to run a slash command through bash. Skills live under this package's `skills/`.
  Generated project skills go to `.pi/skills/`; personal skills to
  `~/.pi/agent/skills/`. Do not write Cursor rules or Cursor settings.
- Use OptChat's visible memory, `zoom` and `date` for recall and reflection.
  Build a scoped digest for reviewers. Do not scan Cursor transcript directories,
  other projects' chats, credentials, or raw private memory files.
- `/setup-pstack` describes the Pi configuration, not Cursor role budgets.
  Model/effort and child extension configuration stay in the Nix-managed Pi
  module and OptChat config. Do not mutate store-managed files.
- `cursor-team-kit` is not installed. `/deslop` becomes a local diff/code-quality
  review and `/unslop` handles prose. Browser/GUI verification needs an available
  tool or user assistance. Do not invent `control-ui`, `control-cli`, `drive`,
  Origin, Cursor APIs, or MCP services. Report unavailable checks as gaps.
- Bundled helper scripts are upstream references, not installed commands. Inspect
  a script and dependencies before using it. Bun, gh, simulators and credentials
  are NOT provisioned by this package. Do not run bootstrap/install scripts or
  watchers automatically. Prefer available Pi tools and bounded manual checks.
- Installation or mode activation grants no permission to commit, push, open or
  merge PRs, deploy, delete data, contact others, or disable protections. Ask when
  these actions lack authorization. Do not turn `/loop` examples into loops.
- `/poteto-mode` persists per Pi session and is re-injected into model context,
  including with OptChat context replacement. `/poteto-mode off` disables it.
  `/pstack` shows status; `/pstack off` clears the mode. Other commands apply one
  workflow to the supplied task, not a permanent global mode. Casual turns need
  not run engineering playbooks. `/skill:poteto-mode` loads instructions once;
  use `/poteto-mode` for persistent activation.


## Adapted upstream workflow


# Attack the Premise

When two or more fixes that share one premise have failed the same gate, suspect the premise, not the fixes.

**Why:** Each failure under a shared premise is evidence about the premise.

**Pattern:**
- **Write the premise down.** The premise is the one sentence that every failed fix assumed.
- **Take a census before the next fix.** Count the imbalance per actor. The census shows which actors hold the imbalance, not how large it is. Write the census as a rerunnable script per [Build the Lever](../principle-build-the-lever/SKILL.md).
- **Read the skew.** If the same few actors hold most of the imbalance on every run, something assigns them that role. Find what assigns the role. That assignment is the next "why" per [Fix Root Causes](../principle-fix-root-causes/SKILL.md).
- **Remove the asymmetry instead of compensating for it**, per the [Laziness Protocol](../principle-laziness-protocol/SKILL.md). Rotate the role between actors, randomize the assignment, or move the role, so that no actor holds it on every run. A return path, a shared pool, a batched hand-off, or a periodic rebalance leaves the assignment in place and adds work on every run.

**Stop:**
- Do not start the next fix before the premise is written down and the census exists.
- If the census is even across actors, the premise is not the cause. Look for the cause elsewhere and keep the census as evidence.

This principle is distinct from [Redesign from First Principles](../principle-redesign-from-first-principles/SKILL.md), which rebuilds a design around a new requirement. It questions a fact the current design assumes.
