# Pi runtime contract

This contract adapts the bundled Cursor pstack instructions to Pi. Where the
upstream text describes Cursor-only behavior, use this contract instead.
It never overrides system instructions, AGENTS.md, permissions, or sandbox rules.

- `Task` means OptChat `spawn({tasks: [...]})`. Only delegate when the user has
  requested subagents or explicitly invoked a delegation workflow such as
  `/swarm`, `/architect`, `/interrogate`, `/how`, `/why`, `/arena`, or `/reflect`.
  Enabling `/poteto-mode` alone does not authorize subagents for every task.
- OptChat returns IDs immediately. Never sleep, poll, or wait for children.
  Continue independent work or end the turn and explain what is running.
  Reports arrive automatically. Aggregate only after the relevant batch reports.
  `tell({id,message})` steers running children; finished children cannot resume.
- Children inherit the configured OptChat model/effort, run locally in the same
  workspace, and cannot spawn recursively. Ignore Cursor model slugs, role-model
  rules, cloud environments, `Task` model parameters, and `subagent_type` fields.
  Different reviewer briefs are different perspectives, NOT different models.
  If a workflow needs nested delegation, have the parent coordinate its stages.
- For a poteto delegate, include paths to `agents/poteto-agent.md`, this contract,
  the relevant SKILL.md and playbook in the brief. For comment review include
  `agents/comment-sicko.md`. Paths are relative to this package root. Ask the
  child to read them. Every brief includes scope, verification, and report format.
- Children share the working tree. Use read-only reviews or disjoint write
  scopes. Do not assume separate branches or cloud worktrees exist. Never let
  workers edit the same files concurrently without explicit isolation.
- `AskQuestion` means `ask_user_question` if available. Otherwise ask in chat.
  Never skip an approval because the prompt asks for autonomy. A plan/todolist
  is a concise Markdown checklist, not a nonexistent Cursor tool.
- Invocation of another skill means read its SKILL.md and apply it; do not try
  to run a slash command through bash. Skills live under this package's `skills/`.
  Generated project skills go to `.pi/skills/`; personal skills to
  `~/.pi/agent/skills/`. Do not write Cursor rules or Cursor settings.
- Use OptChat's visible memory, `zoom` and `date` for recall and reflection.
  Build a scoped digest for reviewers. Do not scan Cursor transcript directories,
  other projects' chats, credentials, or raw private memory files.
- `/setup-pstack` describes the Pi configuration, not Cursor role budgets.
  Model/effort and child extension configuration stay in the Nix-managed Pi
  module and OptChat config. Do not mutate store-managed files.
- `cursor-team-kit` is not installed. `/deslop` becomes a local diff/code-quality
  review and `/unslop` handles prose. Browser/GUI verification needs an available
  tool or user assistance. Do not invent `control-ui`, `control-cli`, `drive`,
  Origin, Cursor APIs, or MCP services. Report unavailable checks as gaps.
- Bundled helper scripts are upstream references, not installed commands. Inspect
  a script and dependencies before using it. Bun, gh, simulators and credentials
  are NOT provisioned by this package. Do not run bootstrap/install scripts or
  watchers automatically. Prefer available Pi tools and bounded manual checks.
- Installation or mode activation grants no permission to commit, push, open or
  merge PRs, deploy, delete data, contact others, or disable protections. Ask when
  these actions lack authorization. Do not turn `/loop` examples into loops.
- `/poteto-mode` persists per Pi session and is re-injected into model context,
  including with OptChat context replacement. `/poteto-mode off` disables it.
  `/pstack` shows status; `/pstack off` clears the mode. Other commands apply one
  workflow to the supplied task, not a permanent global mode. Casual turns need
  not run engineering playbooks. `/skill:poteto-mode` loads instructions once;
  use `/poteto-mode` for persistent activation.


## Adapted upstream workflow


# Arena

Fan out N parallel attempts at the same task. Read every candidate end to end. Pick the strongest as the base. Graft the best ideas from the others into it. Verify the synthesized result.

## Start

Open a todolist with one entry per phase before launching anything.

1. Frame
2. Fan out
3. Cross-judge
4. Pick
5. Graft
6. Verify

## Phase A: Frame

The N candidates will receive the same prompt, so the prompt is the contract.

1. State the artifact each candidate is producing.
2. Derive the rubric. State what success looks like for *this* task, then turn it into 3-6 concrete gradeable criteria. The rubric is the picker's tool in Phase D. Candidates only see the task.
3. Pick the runners. Use the `arena runners` line in `~/.cursor/rules/pstack-models.mdc`. If the rule or that line is missing, default to one each on `claude-opus-5-5-xhigh` and `grok-4.7-xhigh-fast`. An `auto` or `inherit-parent` entry in this line or the cross-judge line means the parent model, so omit `model` for it. If the Task tool rejects a configured entry, run that seat on its family's default and say so. Families go by prefix: `claude-*` and `grok-*`. With no family match, use `claude-opus-5-5-xhigh`. If it rejects a default, use the closest valid slug of the same family from its error message. Spawn more when the arena covers multiple design directions. Same model N times when the work is generation-bound rather than judgment-sensitive.
4. Assign output paths. Each candidate writes to its own location (a git worktree where possible, otherwise `/tmp/arena-<slug>/candidate-<n>/`), per the **separate-before-serializing-shared-state** principle skill.

## Phase B: Fan out

Spawn all N subagents in one message with `run_in_background: true`, each with the task, the path to the shared grounding, its own output path, and instructions to produce both the artifact and a short rationale.

Each rationale names the alternatives the candidate considered and what it rejected.

If a candidate fails to produce output, proceed with N-1 and note the dropout in the synthesis record.

## Phase C: Cross-judge

After all Phase B candidates complete, choose one model from the `arena cross-judge pool` line in `~/.cursor/rules/pstack-models.mdc`. If the rule or that line is missing, choose from `claude-opus-5-5-xhigh` and `grok-4.7-xhigh-fast`. Prefer a different model family from the parent's. Spawn one readonly judge subagent on that model. It sees the rubric and the candidates by path label, scores each criterion, and recommends a base with rationale. It runs in parallel with the parent's reading in Phase D, not with the candidates themselves. Don't spawn the judge while candidates are still writing.

## Phase D: Pick a base

Read every candidate end to end before picking.

Score each candidate against the rubric criterion by criterion, not on holistic feel. Compare against the cross-judge. Agreement on the base confirms the pick. Disagreement means one of you is biased or the rubric was ambiguous. Read both rationales before deciding.

Pick the base on which candidate a future maintainer can extend most easily without breaking invariants. Prefer the cleaner boundary or smaller API when two feel tied, per the Laziness Protocol.

Record the pick and the reason in a short synthesis note alongside the base artifact, including the cross-judge's verdict.

## Phase E: Graft

Walk each losing candidate once more and identify what is worth porting into the base. The signal is usually one or two things per candidate, not most of it.

Fold each graft in by hand, per the **redesign-from-first-principles** principle skill. Don't paste mechanically. The result has to remain coherent under one mental model.

Record what was grafted, from which candidate, and what was rejected and why.

When N candidates converge on the same shape, that is a strong agreement signal. Note the convergence in the record and ship the consensus shape. No graft is needed. When N candidates wildly diverge, Phase A was under-specified. Reframe and re-run rather than averaging the divergence.

## Phase F: Verify

The synthesized artifact has to hold up under the same scrutiny as any other output, per the **prove-it-works** principle skill.

If verification surfaces a problem the arena did not catch, either Phase A was wrong (re-frame and re-run) or one candidate caught it and you missed the graft (go back to Phase E). Don't paper over.

## Outputs

One synthesized artifact. One short synthesis note alongside, naming the base, the grafts (with source candidate), the rejections, the dropouts if any, and the verification result.
