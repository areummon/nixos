# Pi runtime contract

This contract adapts the bundled Cursor pstack instructions to Pi. Where the
upstream text describes Cursor-only behavior, use this contract instead.
It never overrides system instructions, AGENTS.md, permissions, or sandbox rules.

- `Task` means OptChat `spawn({tasks: [...]})`. Only delegate when the user has
  requested subagents or explicitly invoked a delegation workflow such as
  `/swarm`, `/architect`, `/interrogate`, `/how`, `/why`, `/arena`, or `/reflect`.
  Enabling `/poteto-mode` alone does not authorize subagents for every task.
- OptChat returns IDs immediately. Never sleep, poll, or wait for children.
  Continue independent work or end the turn and explain what is running.
  Reports arrive automatically. Aggregate only after the relevant batch reports.
  `tell({id,message})` steers running children; finished children cannot resume.
- Children inherit the configured OptChat model/effort, run locally in the same
  workspace, and cannot spawn recursively. Ignore Cursor model slugs, role-model
  rules, cloud environments, `Task` model parameters, and `subagent_type` fields.
  Different reviewer briefs are different perspectives, NOT different models.
  If a workflow needs nested delegation, have the parent coordinate its stages.
- For a poteto delegate, include paths to `agents/poteto-agent.md`, this contract,
  the relevant SKILL.md and playbook in the brief. For comment review include
  `agents/comment-sicko.md`. Paths are relative to this package root. Ask the
  child to read them. Every brief includes scope, verification, and report format.
- Children share the working tree. Use read-only reviews or disjoint write
  scopes. Do not assume separate branches or cloud worktrees exist. Never let
  workers edit the same files concurrently without explicit isolation.
- `AskQuestion` means `ask_user_question` if available. Otherwise ask in chat.
  Never skip an approval because the prompt asks for autonomy. A plan/todolist
  is a concise Markdown checklist, not a nonexistent Cursor tool.
- Invocation of another skill means read its SKILL.md and apply it; do not try
  to run a slash command through bash. Skills live under this package's `skills/`.
  Generated project skills go to `.pi/skills/`; personal skills to
  `~/.pi/agent/skills/`. Do not write Cursor rules or Cursor settings.
- Use OptChat's visible memory, `zoom` and `date` for recall and reflection.
  Build a scoped digest for reviewers. Do not scan Cursor transcript directories,
  other projects' chats, credentials, or raw private memory files.
- `/setup-pstack` describes the Pi configuration, not Cursor role budgets.
  Model/effort and child extension configuration stay in the Nix-managed Pi
  module and OptChat config. Do not mutate store-managed files.
- `cursor-team-kit` is not installed. `/deslop` becomes a local diff/code-quality
  review and `/unslop` handles prose. Browser/GUI verification needs an available
  tool or user assistance. Do not invent `control-ui`, `control-cli`, `drive`,
  Origin, Cursor APIs, or MCP services. Report unavailable checks as gaps.
- Bundled helper scripts are upstream references, not installed commands. Inspect
  a script and dependencies before using it. Bun, gh, simulators and credentials
  are NOT provisioned by this package. Do not run bootstrap/install scripts or
  watchers automatically. Prefer available Pi tools and bounded manual checks.
- Installation or mode activation grants no permission to commit, push, open or
  merge PRs, deploy, delete data, contact others, or disable protections. Ask when
  these actions lack authorization. Do not turn `/loop` examples into loops.
- `/poteto-mode` persists per Pi session and is re-injected into model context,
  including with OptChat context replacement. `/poteto-mode off` disables it.
  `/pstack` shows status; `/pstack off` clears the mode. Other commands apply one
  workflow to the supplied task, not a permanent global mode. Casual turns need
  not run engineering playbooks. `/skill:poteto-mode` loads instructions once;
  use `/poteto-mode` for persistent activation.


## Adapted upstream workflow


# Create a verification skill

Every serious project needs a scripted way to drive the real app and prove behavior: launch it, exercise a feature the way a user would, and capture evidence. This skill generates that as a project-local skill (`.pi/skills/verify-<app>/`) tailored to the repo. You write the generator's output for the next agent, not for a human: it will be read cold, mid-task, by an agent that has never seen the app.

## 1. Interview the repo, not the user

Answer these from the codebase and only ask the user what you cannot observe:

- **Surface:** what does a user actually touch? A web UI, a CLI/TUI, a desktop app, an API, a mobile app, a library? A repo can have several; pick the primary one and note the rest.
- **Run:** how does the app start locally? Prefer the repo's own documented dev command (package scripts, Makefile, README quickstart). Note ports, env vars, seed data, auth.
- **Drive:** how can an agent interact with it programmatically? Existing harnesses first — Playwright/Cypress specs, expect scripts, PTY helpers, curl-able endpoints, a debug port. Only then pick a generic recipe: browser/CDP for web and Electron, a tmux/PTY harness for CLI/TUI, plain HTTP for services.
- **Observe:** what evidence can be captured? Screenshots, terminal transcripts, response bodies, logs, exit codes, DB state.
- **Isolate:** can two instances run side by side (ports, data dirs, profiles)? If not, say so in the generated skill: refusing to double-drive a shared instance beats corrupting the user's session.

If the checkout doesn't build or start as-is, fix that first (or report it precisely) before generating; a skill written against a broken base teaches wrong steps. When an irrelevant missing asset blocks startup (a static dir the API never serves, a sample config), the generated skill may create it, clearly marked as verification scaffolding, and remove it in cleanup.

## 2. Generate the skill

Write `.pi/skills/verify-<app>/SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter (`name: verify-<app>` and a `description` that names the app, the surface, and when to reach for it — without frontmatter the skill never registers) and these sections, each grounded in what the interview actually found (no placeholders left):

- **Launch:** the exact command that starts the app for verification, and how to tell it's ready (a log line, a port answering, a prompt). Include teardown. For a short-lived CLI or TUI there is no server to keep alive: launch means build the binary (or install deps) once, then start each drive in its own isolated PTY or tmux session.
- **Doctor:** one read-only check that answers "is this instance worth driving?" — process up, right version/build, port owned by us, auth valid. An agent runs this first whenever anything looks off.
- **Drive:** the harness recipe with real selectors/commands from this repo, not examples. Prefer stable handles (ARIA labels, data attributes, prompt strings, route paths) over coordinates and tab order.
- **Evidence:** what to capture for a proof and where it goes. State the proof standards: exercise the real user path, not internal setters or test-only endpoints; capture the action and the resulting state, not just the final screen; verify side effects (files written, rows inserted, messages sent) alongside what's visible; mocks only where a production boundary already isolates the external system. When the safe path is a dry-run or test mode, verify what it actually skips by observing (files, network, git refs) rather than trusting its name: some dry-runs still touch the network or open a browser.
- **Cleanup:** how to tear down instances the run created. Never kill by process name; kill what you started. Cleanup removes instances and scratch state, never the evidence: proof artifacts survive the teardown, in a location the skill names.
- **Helpers:** any script the skill ships is executable and its invocation is shown in the skill body. A helper the reader has to reverse-engineer is not a helper.

## 3. Seed the feature map

Create `.pi/skills/verify-<app>/features/README.md` plus one file per user-facing feature you can identify (aim for the top 3-5 to start, from routes, commands, menus, or docs). Follow the shape in [`references/feature-map-example/`](references/feature-map-example/), with a README index and one file per feature. Each file answers, from the user's point of view: what the feature is, how to reach it, how to drive it with the harness, and what observable end state proves it works. The four H2s are `Sub-features`, `How to get to it (user POV)`, `Driving it with <harness>`, and `Gotchas`. The map is the repo's maintained verification source; a proof that drives one convenient entry point is incomplete when the map lists others.

## 4. Prove the generated skill before handing it over

Run its own instructions end to end once: launch, doctor, drive ONE mapped feature (one is enough; the map exists so later runs can cover the rest), capture evidence, clean up. After cleanup, confirm the evidence still exists at the named location — a cleanup that eats the proof fails this step. Fix what fails, and run the generated cleanup after every failed iteration too, so broken attempts don't strand processes and ports. A generated skill that was never executed is a draft, not a deliverable.

## 5. Offer the maintenance loop

Point the user at `/maintain-verification-skill` for keeping the map honest as the app changes. Suggest a cadence only if they ask.
