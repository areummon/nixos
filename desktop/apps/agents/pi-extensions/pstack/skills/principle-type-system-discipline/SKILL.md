# Pi runtime contract

This contract adapts the bundled Cursor pstack instructions to Pi. Where the
upstream text describes Cursor-only behavior, use this contract instead.
It never overrides system instructions, AGENTS.md, permissions, or sandbox rules.

- `Task` means OptChat `spawn({tasks: [...]})`. Only delegate when the user has
  requested subagents or explicitly invoked a delegation workflow such as
  `/swarm`, `/architect`, `/interrogate`, `/how`, `/why`, `/arena`, or `/reflect`.
  Enabling `/poteto-mode` alone does not authorize subagents for every task.
- OptChat returns IDs immediately. Never sleep, poll, or wait for children.
  Continue independent work or end the turn and explain what is running.
  Reports arrive automatically. Aggregate only after the relevant batch reports.
  `tell({id,message})` steers running children; finished children cannot resume.
- Children inherit the configured OptChat model/effort, run locally in the same
  workspace, and cannot spawn recursively. Ignore Cursor model slugs, role-model
  rules, cloud environments, `Task` model parameters, and `subagent_type` fields.
  Different reviewer briefs are different perspectives, NOT different models.
  If a workflow needs nested delegation, have the parent coordinate its stages.
- For a poteto delegate, include paths to `agents/poteto-agent.md`, this contract,
  the relevant SKILL.md and playbook in the brief. For comment review include
  `agents/comment-sicko.md`. Paths are relative to this package root. Ask the
  child to read them. Every brief includes scope, verification, and report format.
- Children share the working tree. Use read-only reviews or disjoint write
  scopes. Do not assume separate branches or cloud worktrees exist. Never let
  workers edit the same files concurrently without explicit isolation.
- `AskQuestion` means `ask_user_question` if available. Otherwise ask in chat.
  Never skip an approval because the prompt asks for autonomy. A plan/todolist
  is a concise Markdown checklist, not a nonexistent Cursor tool.
- Invocation of another skill means read its SKILL.md and apply it; do not try
  to run a slash command through bash. Skills live under this package's `skills/`.
  Generated project skills go to `.pi/skills/`; personal skills to
  `~/.pi/agent/skills/`. Do not write Cursor rules or Cursor settings.
- Use OptChat's visible memory, `zoom` and `date` for recall and reflection.
  Build a scoped digest for reviewers. Do not scan Cursor transcript directories,
  other projects' chats, credentials, or raw private memory files.
- `/setup-pstack` describes the Pi configuration, not Cursor role budgets.
  Model/effort and child extension configuration stay in the Nix-managed Pi
  module and OptChat config. Do not mutate store-managed files.
- `cursor-team-kit` is not installed. `/deslop` becomes a local diff/code-quality
  review and `/unslop` handles prose. Browser/GUI verification needs an available
  tool or user assistance. Do not invent `control-ui`, `control-cli`, `drive`,
  Origin, Cursor APIs, or MCP services. Report unavailable checks as gaps.
- Bundled helper scripts are upstream references, not installed commands. Inspect
  a script and dependencies before using it. Bun, gh, simulators and credentials
  are NOT provisioned by this package. Do not run bootstrap/install scripts or
  watchers automatically. Prefer available Pi tools and bounded manual checks.
- Installation or mode activation grants no permission to commit, push, open or
  merge PRs, deploy, delete data, contact others, or disable protections. Ask when
  these actions lack authorization. Do not turn `/loop` examples into loops.
- `/poteto-mode` persists per Pi session and is re-injected into model context,
  including with OptChat context replacement. `/poteto-mode off` disables it.
  `/pstack` shows status; `/pstack off` clears the mode. Other commands apply one
  workflow to the supplied task, not a permanent global mode. Casual turns need
  not run engineering playbooks. `/skill:poteto-mode` loads instructions once;
  use `/poteto-mode` for persistent activation.


## Adapted upstream workflow


# Type System Discipline

The type checker is a proof assistant. Use it to eliminate impossible states, mismatched primitives, and unhandled variants at compile time. A case the types let you ignore becomes a runtime failure the compiler could have stopped. Prefer defining errors and special cases out of existence over proliferating handlers. Unrepresentable states, total functions, and interface redesign (the patterns below) are the tools.

Applies to any typed language. Skills like `typescript-best-practices` ground it in specific syntax.

**The patterns:**

- **Make illegal states unrepresentable.** Model variants as sum types: discriminated unions in TypeScript, enums with payloads in Rust/Swift/Kotlin, sealed classes in Scala, ADTs in Haskell/OCaml. Don't model state as a bag of optional fields where contradictory combinations compile. A subtle anti-pattern: `{ completed: boolean; completedAt?: Date }` admits `completed: true; completedAt: undefined`, which is meaningless. Derive the boolean from a single source like `completedAt !== null`, or model the variants explicitly as `{ kind: 'open' } | { kind: 'done'; at: Date }`. If a bug forces the question "wait, can this combination actually happen?", the type is too loose.
- **Types are constructions, not restrictions.** Build the type up from the values you want instead of carving them out of a looser type with checks. The invariant that seems to need a refinement type is usually a construction away. A non-empty list is a head plus a rest, not a list with a length check. A valid time range is a start plus a duration, not two timestamps you must keep ordered. No representation is privileged. A list of pairs is an even-length list if you interpret it that way, so choose the shape that cannot build the illegal value and expose the interface callers need on top.
- **Brand semantic primitives.** `UserId` and `OrderId` are strings underneath but should not be interchangeable. Newtypes in Rust, opaque types in Swift, value classes in Kotlin, phantom types in Haskell, branded intersections in TypeScript. Validate once at creation, trust the type downstream.
- **External data is untyped until parsed.** RPC payloads, JSON, IPC messages, CLI args, config files, environment variables, database rows. Have a parse function at every boundary that turns unstructured input into the typed model. See the **boundary-discipline** principle skill for where to put validation.
- **Don't lie to the type system.** Casts, unsafe coercions, and assertion functions that bypass the compiler are latent runtime crashes. If the compiler can't prove a fact, prove it (validate, narrow, refine the model) or accept that the cast is a hazard.
- **Exhaustive matching is the compiler's job.** When you match on a sum type, the compiler must fail compilation if a new variant is added without handling. Use the idiom your language provides: `never`-typed binding in TypeScript, unannotated `match` in Rust, `-Wincomplete-patterns` in Haskell, sealed-class match exhaustiveness in Kotlin.
- **Derive types from authoritative schemas.** When a protocol buffer, OpenAPI spec, GraphQL schema, database migration, or design-system token file defines a shape, derive from it instead of hand-rolling a parallel type. See the **encode-lessons-in-structure** principle skill.
- **Strengthen a type only where partiality appears.** A runtime assertion, null check, or "this should never happen" throw marks the place a type is too weak. Push that check up into the type. Then stop. The type system's job is to track the cases each use site must handle, not to describe the data as precisely as possible. Prefer total functions. `sum` of an empty list is 0, so it takes the plain list. `head` of an empty list has no answer, so it demands the non-empty one.

**The tests:**

- "Can I write a comment explaining when this combination of fields is valid?" If yes, the type is too loose. Split it into a sum type.
- "Do two of my function arguments share a primitive type but mean different things?" Brand them.
- "Where did this `any`, this `as`, this `assertNotNull` come from?" Trace it to the boundary and validate there instead.
- "If a new variant is added next month, will the compiler tell the next agent where to add a case?" If no, the match isn't exhaustive.
- "Is this type duplicating a shape another file owns?" Derive instead.
- "Am I strengthening this type to keep an operation total, or just to be more precise?" If nothing would otherwise panic, keep the plain type.
